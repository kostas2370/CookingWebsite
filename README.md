## About Me

My name is Kostas Damianos and I am a developer from Greece. I have a passion for creating high-quality and easy-to-use web applications, and that is why I created My Cooking App. This platform is designed to make it easy for anyone to create a cooking blog and share their favorite recipes with the world.

I have used my expertise in Python Django, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, SQLite, Django-storage, django-crispy-forms, and Pillow to create this application. I believe that the combination of these technologies provides a powerful and robust solution for building a cooking blog.
